# insertTranslation.js

A simple tool which translates the longest word in selection by pressing ctrl+alt combination.

The tool is still in development, so its functionality is very limited now. For example, the tool is not yet able to let user choose source and target language, default source language is Russian.

The script `insertTranslation.userscript.js` is formatted for Greasemonkey.
